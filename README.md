# CSV-to-PostgreSQL
The goal of this project is to transfer the information in a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database

We will be using psycopg2 and handling the data in Python. Please note that you will need a working PostgreSQL
database to complete this exercise. This directory contains two .csv files and the python script for importing 
them into the PostgreSQL tables. 

In order to run the script, do the following:
1. Create a PostgreSQL database called "austin_weather_energy"
2. Create a user for the database
3. Download the two .csv files to a directory on your computer
4. Run the two Python files (remember to change location specific details and user information)
